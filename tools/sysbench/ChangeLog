	* --ob test ob using mysqlclient
	* Add join test mode
	* Version 0.4.12.

2009-03-19  Alexey Kopytov  <alexeyk@mysql.com>

	* Made forced shutdown introduced in 0.4.11 optional via the --forced-shutdown
	  switch and off by default.
	* Version 0.4.12.

2009-03-15  Alexey Kopytov  <alexeyk@mysql.com>

	* Added --oltp-reconnect-mode to the OLTP test.
	* Minor fixes to remove compiler warnings and DocBook processing on Mac OS X.
	* Added forced test shutdown to avoid endless execution when DB server freezes
	* Backport of Windows support from the 0.5 branch 
	  (patch contributed by John Lewis).
	* Version 0.4.11.

2008-12-18  Alexey Kopytov  <alexeyk@mysql.com>
	    
	* Fixed the bug with empty --mysql-create-options
	* Merge two patches from Tim Cook:
	- use lrand48() as random() is not thread-safe on most platforms
	- use libumem/mtmalloc for memory allocation if available on the target platform
	* Got rid of some unnecessary malloc() calls in drv_mysql.c
	* version 0.4.10

2008-12-09  Alexey Kopytov  <alexeyk@mysql.com>

	* Some Makefile cleanups to fix 'make distcheck'
	* Set stdout to non-buffered mode to get error messages in case of a fatal 
	  error.
	* New --with-extra-ldflags switch in configure. One example where it might be 
	  useful:
	  './configure --with-extra-ldflags=-all-static' will instruct libtool to try 
	  to create a static binary if supported by the target platform.
	* New option in the mysql driver --mysql-create-options. Allows to pass
	  an additional string to CREATE TABLE.
	* Fixed the crash with an empty --mysql-engine-trx
	* Temporarily disabled the call to mysql_options() due to MySQL bug #40552
	* Added Maria, PBXT and Falcon to the list of "known" storage engines.
	* Patch from Philip Guenther that fixes the following issues:
	  1) wrong call to read the thread-stack-size config variable,
	   such that the stack size was set to 32 *bytes* instead of 32 kilobytes
	  2) assumed that pthread_create() and pthread_join() set errno.  They
	   don't: they return the error value instead
	* 2 patches from Jeremy Cole:
	  1) File I/O test: moves the timer stop after fsync so that --file-fsync-all 
	    timings are useful in the fileio test.  Before the patch, the timings are 
	    garbage, but after they reflect theoretical disk performance quite nicely,
	    as they should.
	  2) Changed the per-request statistics to show milliseconds instead of 
	     seconds, which is quite often more interesting.
	* Patch from Hakan Kuecuekyilmaz that adds the 'version' command
	* version 0.4.9
